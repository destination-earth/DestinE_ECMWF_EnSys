# Welcome to the repository of the Destination Earth Use Case Energy Systems!

The Destination Earth Use Case Energy Systems is a joint activity of [DLR](https://www.dlr.de/ve/en), [Aarhus University](https://ece.au.dk/en/),
 and the [Renewables Grid Initiative](https://renewables-grid.eu) with the aim to implement a representative Demonstrator for 
 the use of climate information in numerical energy systems models.

This repository is maintained by DLR in support of ECMWFâ€˜s role in Destination Earth funded by the European Union. For comments and questions please contact: Bruno Schyska (<bruno.schyska@dlr.de>).

## Content
For the moment, this repository includes a reference to our [Demonstrator](https://github.com/dlr-ve-esy/DestinE_EnSys_Demonstrator/tree/c64da52d70e9a07718bf51aa5ec61f55a639d899). The publication of further developments for the sensitivity analysis of energy system models and for approaches to reduce the complexity of the models is planned.

For the Demonstrator we have also implemented a workflow to collect the data needed to build a simplified [European Resources Adequacy Assessment](https://www.entsoe.eu/outlooks/eraa/) from ENTSO-E websites, which can also be used stand-alone: [eraa-resources](https://github.com/dlr-ve-esy/eraa-resources).
